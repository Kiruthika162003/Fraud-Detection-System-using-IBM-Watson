# Step 1: Define Objectives and Fraud Types
fraud_types = ['credit_card_fraud', 'identity_theft', 'phishing_scam', ...]

# Step 2: Data Collection and Preparation (Assuming data is in a DataFrame 'data')
# Data preprocessing steps (cleaning and feature engineering) can be performed here

# Step 3: Data Preprocessing (Assume features are in 'X' and target variable in 'y')
# Preprocessing steps such as encoding categorical variables can be performed here

# Step 4: Train/Test Data Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 5: Choose a Machine Learning Algorithm (RandomForestClassifier in this case)
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Step 6: Train the Model
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 7: Evaluate the Model
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
